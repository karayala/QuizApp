# QuizApp

# Class: CS407
# Assignment: Project 1 (Android)
# Creation dates: 02/14/2016-02/15/2016
# Intent: The creation of a simple Android application that serves as a simple quiz with image and text fragments. The goal was to use 3 activities and 2 fragments in the process. The UI was meant to be as simple and intuitive as possible.
# Current Errors: None known
# Refinements needed: (1) Importation of better GUI with the use of Sketch UI. (2) Connecting the quiz service to online database service (firebase). (3) Obtaining user input
# Problems Faced:
  (1) Storage methods of data had to be updated. Initially, I had used a simple linked list, only to find that the run-time for such a storage method was too high and can be improved. I ended up switching to a simple linked list. I figured that for the purpose of this project, the amount of items within the quiz questions can be kept statically. In the futures, I hope that the refinements would allow me to make it dynamic enough to be able to allow for easy additions of quiz questions. In addition, I'm hoping that this could be done online. 
  (2) Misc. problems with emulators crashing, etc.
